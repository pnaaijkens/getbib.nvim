INTRODUCTION						       *getbib-intro*

A plugin to look up and add BibTeX entries based on bibliographic identifiers
such as arXiv ID, DOI or MathSciNet reference. Metadata retrieval is done by
an external program, such as `pybibget`. As such, supported identifiers and
output depend on the external program used. See |getbib-config| for further
details.

The plugin defines two commands (see |getbib-commands| for details). The
first, `:GetBib`, looks up the BibTeX for the identifier(s) and inserts or
replaces the resulting data in the current buffer. The command `:GetBibPopup`
works similarly, but displays the result in a floating window instead of
inserting it in the buffer.

Identifiers can be specified in more than one way. The plugin tries to be
smart to find identifiers. The options are:

    1. Supply the identifiers as arguments to the functions above. Each
       identifier should be separated by a space.

    2. Select the identifier(s) in visual mode and run one of the commmands.
       A default keymap <Leader>gb is provided. If BibTeX data is found, the 
       selected text is replaced by the BibTeX data, or it is displayed in a
       float.

    3. Call the command without any parameters and not from visual mode. In
       this case, the plugin tries to find the <cword> under the cursor 
       (with custom settings appropriate for identifiers). The plugin then 
       works the same as in method 2, with the <cword> selected in visual
       mode.

=============================================================================
CONFIGURATION						      *getbib-config*

Currently the plugin only supports `pybibget`, v0.1.1 or higher. See
https://github.com/wirhabenzeit/pybibget for details. At present, the latest
version on `pypi` is v0.1.0, so you will need to install it directly from
Github, using
>sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/wirhabenzeit/pybibget.git
<
The command `pybibget` is assumed to be available in `$PATH`$. If it is
located in a different location, set the `cmd` configuration option, e.g.
>lua
    require("getbib").setup( { cmd = "/path/to/pybibget" } )
<

You can check the configuration with `:checkhealth bibget`.

NOTE: Some options for `pybibget`, e.g. looking up MathSciNet references,
require a relevant subscription or API key. See the linked page above for more
information.

=============================================================================
KEYMAPS							      *getbib-keymap*

The plugin defines two key mappings. A global mapping `<Leader>gb` opens up a
float with BibTeX data for the identified under the cursor. If the |filetype|
is `bib`, a buffer-local mapping `<Leader>gb` is defined in visual mode. This
replaces the visually selected text with the retrieved BibTeX data.

NOTE: Due to limitations of the external programs, if more than one identifier
is selected, but only for some of them BibTeX data is returned, there is no
indication of which identifiers are missing.

=============================================================================
COMMANDS						      *getbib-commands*

There are two commands defined to retrieve BibTeX data. They work on the same
way, but one displays the results in a floating window, whilst the other
inserts (or replaces) it in the current buffer.

								*:GetBib*
								*:GetBibPopup*
:GetBib		<id1> ... <idN>
:GetBibPopup	<id1> ... <idN>

    Retrieve BibTeX data for the specified arguments. The <id>s can be an
    arXiv identfier, DOI, or MathSciNet reference. See `pybibget`
    documentation for valid options. The resulting data is either inserted
    into the buffer or displayed in a floating popup window (for the
    `:GetBibPopup` command). If no argument is specified, the id is taken from
    the word under the cursor. If in VISUAL mode, the selected text is used
    for the IDs. The selection is replaced with the retrieved BibTeX data.
